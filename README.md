## Overview

This project implements a collaborative filtering-based product recommendation engine. It analyzes historical user-product interactions to identify patterns and suggest products that a user is likely to be interested in. The system is exposed via a high-performance API, making it easy to integrate with various applications (e.g., e-commerce websites, mobile apps).

## Features

*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Generates tailored product suggestions for individual users based on their past purchases and similar user behavior.
*   **Bulk Recommendation:** Supports generating recommendations for multiple users simultaneously, useful for batch processing or large-scale applications.
*   **API Endpoints:** Provides clear and well-defined API endpoints for seamless integration.
*   **Modular Design:** Organized into distinct components for data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, and inference, promoting maintainability and scalability.
*   **Data Validation:** Ensures data integrity through Pydantic models for API inputs.

## Business Impact

Implementing this product recommendation system can lead to significant business benefits:

*   **Increased Sales & Revenue:** By presenting relevant products, the system encourages users to explore and purchase more, directly boosting sales.
*   **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Personalized suggestions make shopping more convenient and enjoyable, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.
*   **Improved User Engagement:** Keeping users engaged with relevant content can increase time spent on platform and reduce bounce rates.
*   **Better Inventory Management:** Understanding product relationships and popular recommendations can inform inventory decisions and marketing strategies.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** Offering a sophisticated recommendation experience can differentiate the business from competitors.

## Technical Impact

The technical design and implementation choices provide several advantages:

*   **Scalability:** Built with FastAPI, the API is designed for high performance and can handle a large number of requests, making it suitable for growing user bases.
*   **Maintainability:** The clear separation of concerns (data, features, model, API) makes the codebase easy to understand, debug, and extend.
*   **Robustness:** Utilizes established libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for data handling, and `implicit` for efficient collaborative filtering, ensuring reliable operations.
*   **Ease of Integration:** The RESTful API interface allows for straightforward integration with various front-end applications or other microservices.
*   **Machine Learning Best Practices:** Follows a structured approach to machine learning development, including data pipelines, model serialization, and inference patterns.

## Architecture

The system is structured into several key components:

*   `api/`: Contains the FastAPI application and Pydantic models for API request/response handling.
*   `data/`: Placeholder for raw and processed data.
*   `models/`: Stores trained machine learning models.
*   `src/`: The core source code, further divided into:
    *   `data_ingest/`: For loading and validating data.
    *   `features/`: For transforming raw data into features suitable for the model.
    *   `model/`: Implements the product recommendation algorithm.
    *   `pipeline/`: Orchestrates the training and inference workflows.
    *   `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities used across the project.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd product\ recommendation
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    # On Windows
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Prepare Data and Train Model:**
    (Detailed steps for data preparation and model training would go here, e.g., running a specific script or notebook. This project seems to expect data in `data/raw` and `data/processed` and models in `models/trained_models`. You might need to run `training_pipeline.py`.)
    *   *Note: Specific instructions for data loading and model training are not detailed here but would typically involve running scripts like `src/pipeline/training_pipeline.py` after placing your raw data in `data/raw`.* 

5.  **Run the FastAPI application:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn api.main:app --reload
    ```
    The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can view the interactive API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following key Python libraries:

*   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   `numpy`: For numerical operations.
*   `pydantic`: For data validation and settings management.
*   `fastapi`: For building the web API.
*   `scipy`: For scientific computing, especially sparse matrices.
*   `implicit`: For collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms.
*   `xgboost`: (Potentially for future use or other models, currently not explicitly used in the provided code for the recommender).
*   `scikit-learn`: For machine learning utilities (e.g., metrics).
*   `joblib`: For efficient serialization of Python objects (models).
